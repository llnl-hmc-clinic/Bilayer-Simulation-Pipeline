Mara's Accruement of Relevant Algorithms
----------------------------------------

This package is a hodge-podge collection of algorithms and data sets I have 
written in Python during the past years. Most have been used in one way or 
another in our scientific work during that period. Some parts are finished, 
as in known-to-work, and some parts are unfinished, as in utterly-unreliable. 
The responsibility of using it lands therefore squarely on the shoulders of 
each and every such brave person. To put it in other words, this package is
distributed as-is under the GNU General Public License found in the file 
LICENSE.

That being said, I sincerely hope that this package or some part of it will 
be of some further use to somebody besides me. Naturally the focus of this
package reflects my past research activities, namely NMR signal interpretation
and MD simulations. For this end I have written modules that can be used for 
example to convert data files from one format to another or to calculate 
various parameters or otherwise manipulate data. A quick glance of the modules 
included gives:

Atom        -- Molecular primitives, starting from atoms and building up to 
               polypeptides etc. Can be used to build or store molecules.

aux         -- Auxiliary functions. List intersections, quicksort etc.

Biology     -- At the moment only parse_sequence().

Interface   -- Front-end to external programs such as Pales.

IO          -- Input/output interface for different data formats, e.g. PDB.

Library     -- Dictionaries and translation codeces used to convert from
               one naming convention to another.

Linguistics -- Actual translators to do the job.

Logic       -- Simple wrapper functions for chaining together complex 
               logical expressions.

Math        -- Mathematical algorithms.

mpi         -- Multi-processor interface. (untested)

NMR         -- NMR specific data structures. Dipolar coupligns etc.

Physics     -- Algorithms to calculate various physical quantities from the 
               center of mass to electrostatic potentials.

svd         -- Implementation of Singular Value Decomposition.

If you have any suggestion or questions, you can always try to drop me an 
e-mail (m.j.louhivuori@rug.nl), eventhough I do not know whether I will have 
the time to actually make any improvements. On the other hand, if you have 
done any corrections and/or written new additions, I would be delighted to 
receive them and hopefully add them to the package.

Happy hacking!
